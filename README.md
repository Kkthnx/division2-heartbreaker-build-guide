7. Build your character as a Hybrid Red and Blue build, focusing on optimizing both your weapon damage and armor rolls.

8. Prioritize critical hit chance and critical hit damage on your gear rolls. This will significantly increase your chances of landing critical hits and boost your overall damage output.
